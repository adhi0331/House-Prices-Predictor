# House-Prices-Predictor
This repository contains a model that predicts the house prices using a decision tree. 

This model was submitted to the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition. Much of the code was gotten from the tutorial that was presented by Gusthema. The only variation is that this model is generated using SciKit learn instaed of Tensorflow Decision Forests since it is not supported in python3. 

To run the model simply download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and add it to the folder above. Be sure to add the necessary dependicies and the run then run the notebook. If all goes well then there should be a submission.csv file that is generated.
